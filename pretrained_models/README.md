# Pretrained model checkpoints

This directory is for storing pretrained model checkpoints. 
You can download pretrained METL models from the [metl-pretrained](url) repository.

For demonstration purposes, this directory contains a pretrained METL-Local model for avGFP acquired from the [metl-pretrained](url) repository.
This model is `METL-L-2M-3D-GFP` (UUID: `Hr4GNHws`). See the [metl-pretrained](url) repository for more information about this model.

For an example of how to finetune this model on experimental data, see the [finetuning.ipynb](notebooks/finetuning.ipynb) notebook.
